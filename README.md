# Docker Notes

## Hypervisor-based Virtualization

- Physical Server
- Host OS
- Hypervisor
  - Debian
    - Libs/bins
  - Ubuntu
    - Libs/bins

### Benefits

- Cost effective
- Easy to Scale

### Limitations

- Kernel Resource Duplication
- Application Portability Issue

## Container-based

Containers share the same kernel resource.

### Runtime Isolation

- Uses only the minimal requirements
- Allows for fast deployment
- Guaranteed Portability

Example:

- Application A - Container A
  - JRE 8
  - JVM
- Application B - Container B
  - JRE 7

### Docker Client

docker build - Docker daemon
docker pull - Docker daemon
docker run - Docker daemon

Docker Daemon -> Registry (Redis) -> Redis Image
Image -> Container

Docker Daemon

Docker engine - run on remote docker daemon or local.

### Docker Concepts

#### Images

- Images are read as templates used to create containers.
- Images are created with the docker build command, either by us or by other docker users.
- Images are composed of layers of other images.
- Images are stored in Docker registry.

#### Containers

- If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime object.
- Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run programs.
- Containers are created from images. Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application.

### Registries and Repositories

- A registry is where we store our images.
- You can host your own registry, or you can use Docker public registry which is called DockerHub.
- Inside a registry, images are stored repositories.
- Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with the same name, that have different tags, each tag usually means a different version of the image.
