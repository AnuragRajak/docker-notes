# Docker Notes

## Hypervisor-based Virtualization

- Physical Server
- Host OS
- Hypervisor
  - Debian
    - Libs/bins
  - Ubuntu
    - Libs/bins

### Benefits

- Cost effective
- Easy to Scale

### Limitations

- Kernel Resource Duplication
- Application Portability Issue

## Container-based

Containers share the same kernel resource.

### Runtime Isolation

- Uses only the minimal requirements
- Allows for fast deployment
- Guaranteed Portability

Example:

- Application A - Container A
  - JRE 8
  - JVM
- Application B - Container B
  - JRE 7

## Docker Client

docker build - Docker daemon
docker pull - Docker daemon
docker run - Docker daemon

Docker Daemon -> Registry (Redis) -> Redis Image
Image -> Container

Docker Daemon

Docker engine - run on remote docker daemon or local.

## Docker Concepts

### Images

- Images are read as templates used to create containers.
- Images are created with the docker build command, either by us or by other docker users.
- Images are composed of layers of other images.
- Images are stored in Docker registry.

### Containers

- If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime object.
- Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run programs.
- Containers are created from images. Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application.

### Registries and Repositories

- A registry is where we store our images.
- You can host your own registry, or you can use Docker public registry which is called DockerHub.
- Inside a registry, images are stored repositories.
- Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with the same name, that have different tags, each tag usually means a different version of the image.
- DockerHub is a popular service for repositories.
- Official names are reviewed by DockerHub.
- If you don't specify a tag, it defaults to latest.
- Docker will use the local image first if it's available, otherwise it will download it from the network.

## Commands

To list available images use:

```
docker images
```

To use an image to echo "hello world":

```
docker run image echo "hello world"
```

Use -i -t for interactive.

To view currently running Docker containers use:

```
docker ps
```

To use all previous ran containers use -a.

To remove a container use:

```
docker run image --rm
```

To name a container use --name.

Use -d to run in detached mode.

To view low-level docker container information use:

```
docker inspect
```

## Docker Ports & Logging

To run docker on a specific port use:

```
docker run -it -p host_port:container_port tomcat:8.0
```

To view logs from a container use:

```
docker logs container_id
```

## Docker Images

Docker images contain a series of layers. To see the layers an image has use:

```
docker history image
```

1. All changes made to a running containers will be written to a writable layer.
2. When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted, but the underlying image remains unchanged.
3. Multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image.

## Ways to Build an Image

1. Create a Dockerfile.
2. Commit changes made to a Docker container.

To commit your Docker changes use:

```
docker commit container_id repository_name:tag
```
